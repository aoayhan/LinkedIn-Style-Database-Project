# LinkedIn-Style-Database-Project
My database application project based on LinkedIn

This is an ongoing project

I am designing a LinkedIn styled database and will later create an application to interact with it.
The Project Step 1 consisted of project's description
Step 2 was to write the "CREATE TABLE" statements with proper relations and a creating a Relational Model of our database.
Step 3 was creating 3 webpages to edit our database. The first site is used to enter data to db. Second site is to delete a row from a table and all the related tables. And the third page lists the people in our database with the given name.
Step 4 is still being worked on.
